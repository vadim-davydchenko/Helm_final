### Helm chart for installing the Speedtest application with support for various databases
- Create a blank chart named deploy using `helm create deploy`
- Use an image: `registry.rebrainme.com/workshops/middle/kubernetes-local/newplatform_autochecks/speedtest:5.3`
- The image must be loaded from a closed registry with authorization via imagePullSecrets implemented in named templates
- All secrets must be encrypted using helm secrets (sops or vals)
- Standard helm labels and annotations should be added to the new chart manifests
- The application must be run in frontend mode with telemetry storage, ID obfuscation, and no ability to edit IP addresses
- The application supports PostgreSQL and MySQL, add the ability to connect a particular DBMS through dependencies
- Add to Chart.yaml dependencies on PostgreSQL and MySQL
- Implement the ability to enable/disable a specific database using conditions
- Working with the ConfigMap configuration
  - Create a files folder in the chart and place the servers.json file in it
  - Create a ConfigMap from the contents of this folder and mount it in a container
  - Implement automatic processing of all files in a folder by creating a ConfigMap for each
- Hooks for Database initialization
  - Add hooks to the Helm chart to perform initial database initialization.
  - Use scripts from the repository.
  - Implement a similar mechanism with init containers.
- Setting up probes and ingress
  - Enable and configure readiness and liveness tests.
  - Implement Ingress, allowing you to specify the destination port and the service name
- Implement it in values.yaml parameters for:
  - Changes to the deployment strategy
  - The ability to add additional labels and annotations for the Service
  - Specifying environment variables via env.
  - Automatic restart of the pods when the ConfigMap is changed.
  - The ability to override command: [] and args:[] for the container.
  - Support for cert-manager certificates and the Let's Encrypt request.
  - Using helmfile for dependency management
